# iOS Project: Egg Drop
Egg Drop is an iOS game that was independently developed by me in XCode using SpriteKit in Swift for my final project in the course.

# Description
Egg Drop is not your typical endless runner game where the player is forced to run in one direction.
In this endless runner, the player can choose to run in any direction (left or right) at any given time.
The objective of Egg Drop is to avoid the storm of eggs that are falling from the sky. Get hit? It's game over.

I understand that there are several features missing in Egg Drop. A list of these may be found in the 'Design Document'.

# Artwork
To make things clear, the artwork used in Egg Drop are not of my original creation.
These images were &amp; may be found on Google Images. Unfortunately, I do not have the names of their rightful owners.

Screenshots of the Egg Drop are uploaded inside the repository under the directory named 'Screenshots'.
